On this site you can read about my projects background and vision as a professional.
<br><br>
Professionally I would consider myself a full time video-/photographer with a background in studio and sound engineering. Furthermore Iâ€™m an avid mountainbiker and alpine skier.
<br><br>
My background is heavily influenced by music. From a young age i started playing different instruments and quickly started having an interest in the technical aspects of music namely the recording and engineering aspect.
Besides my passion for music, the visual aspect in music: the album covers, music videos, magazine covers and photos of live concerts deeply fascinates me.<br>
After highschool I studied sound and got a diploma in sound engineering. I had a hard time finding paid work in sound engineering. Along this time I started doing video work for the people I had in the studio and did live recordings of. I quickly found out that the visual side. Shooting the video, setting up lights, getting the right shots and the whole post process in video was a lot more entertaining to me. From that my profession slowly turned to primarily doing video and photos.
